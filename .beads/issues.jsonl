{"id":"lazybeads-0rr","title":"Don't make the search panel a modal, utilize the status bar instead","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently, pressing `/` to search opens a **modal dialog** that overlays the entire screen. This blocks the user from seeing the issue list while typing their search query, which feels disconnected and slower.\n\nThe status bar already shows filter results (query text + result counts) after the filter is applied—so the infrastructure for \"search in the status bar\" partially exists.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nReplace the modal-based filter with an **inline search input in the status bar**. Users should be able to:\n1. Press `/` and immediately start typing in the status bar\n2. See the list filter in real-time as they type\n3. Press `Enter` or `Esc` to confirm/exit search mode\n\nThis is similar to vim's `/` search behavior or how many TUI apps (lazygit, etc.) handle search.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Pressing `/` activates search mode with cursor in the status bar\n- [ ] Status bar displays a text input field (e.g., `/: \u003cuser_input\u003e|`)\n- [ ] List panels filter in **real-time** as the user types (no Enter required to see results)\n- [ ] Result counts update live in the status bar (e.g., `3 results: 1 in progress, 2 open`)\n- [ ] `Enter` confirms the filter and returns to normal navigation\n- [ ] `Esc` clears the filter and returns to normal navigation\n- [ ] Filter persists after exiting search mode (same as current behavior)\n- [ ] `Esc` while in normal mode (with active filter) clears the filter\n- [ ] Backspace on empty input exits search mode without clearing existing filter\n- [ ] Status bar returns to showing keybindings when not in search mode and no filter active\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n1. **`internal/app/app.go`**\n   - Remove or repurpose `ViewFilter` mode (may keep for state tracking)\n   - Add `searchMode bool` field to track inline search state\n   - Modify `distributeTasks()` to be called on every keystroke during search\n\n2. **`internal/app/handlers.go`**\n   - Change `/` handler to toggle `searchMode` instead of opening a modal\n   - Route text input to `filterQuery` when `searchMode` is true\n   - Handle `Enter`, `Esc`, and `Backspace` during search mode\n\n3. **`internal/app/views.go`**\n   - Modify `renderStatusBar()` to show an input field when `searchMode` is true\n   - Use a `textinput.Model` from Bubble Tea for proper cursor handling\n   - Keep the result count display for active filters\n\n4. **`internal/ui/modal.go`** (optional cleanup)\n   - Remove `ModalInput` type if no longer needed\n   - Or keep for other field editing (title, etc.)\n\n### Key Architectural Changes\n\n- **Remove modal for filter**: No longer use `ui.NewModalInput` for search\n- **Add text input to model**: Add a `textinput.Model` field for the search input\n- **Real-time filtering**: Call `distributeTasks()` on every character typed\n- **Simpler view mode**: May no longer need `ViewFilter` as a distinct view mode\n\n### UX Details\n\n- Cursor should be visible and blinking in the status bar input\n- Input should have a prefix like `/: ` to indicate search mode\n- Consider showing \"No results\" feedback when filter matches nothing\n- Keep current behavior where pressing `/` again while in search does nothing\n\n### Testing\n\n- Run `lazybeads --check` to verify bd integration still works\n- Manual testing: verify search works, filters live, clears properly\n- Edge cases: empty search, special characters, rapid typing","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"jeremy.saenz","created_at":"2026-01-07T17:10:18.619674-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T18:06:43.457219-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T18:06:43.457219-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented inline search in status bar: pressing / now shows search input directly in status bar with real-time filtering as user types, enter to confirm, esc to clear, backspace on empty to exit"}

The title should appear as part of the border line itself, not inside the panel content.\n\n## Visual Goal\n```\n╭─ In Progress ─────────────────╮\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nInstead of:\n```\n╭───────────────────────────────╮\n│ In Progress                   │\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Research Findings\n\n### Lipgloss Native Support (Coming Soon)\nThere are two open PRs in the lipgloss repository to add this:\n\n1. **PR #384** - `BorderDecoration` API with positioning:\n   ```go\n   style.BorderDecoration(lipgloss.NewBorderDecoration(\n       lipgloss.Top, lipgloss.Center,\n       titleStyle.Render(\"TITLE\"),\n   ))\n   ```\n\n2. **PR #463** - Simpler `BorderTitle(title string)` API\n\n### Current Workaround Options\n\n#### Option A: Manual Border Construction\nBuild the top border manually by combining border characters with the title:\n```go\nfunc renderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width int, focused bool) string {\n    borderStyle := \"─\"\n    corner := \"╭\"\n    rightCorner := \"╮\"\n    \n    // Build: ╭─ Title ─────────╮\n    titlePart := fmt.Sprintf(\" %s \", title)\n    remainingWidth := width - len(titlePart) - 2 // -2 for corners\n    topBorder := corner + borderStyle + titlePart + strings.Repeat(borderStyle, remainingWidth) + rightCorner\n    \n    // Render content with side borders only\n    // Add bottom border\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Option B: Custom Border Definition\nCreate a custom border where the top row includes the title:\n```go\nfunc titleBorder(title string, width int) lipgloss.Border {\n    topLine := \"─ \" + title + \" \" + strings.Repeat(\"─\", width-len(title)-4)\n    return lipgloss.Border{\n        Top: topLine,\n        Bottom: \"─\",\n        Left: \"│\",\n        Right: \"│\",\n        TopLeft: \"╭\",\n        TopRight: \"╮\",\n        BottomLeft: \"╰\",\n        BottomRight: \"╯\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option C: Overlay Approach\nRender the panel with border, then overlay the title on the top border using ANSI positioning (more complex, not recommended).\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Check Lipgloss Version\nFirst check if `BorderTitle` or `BorderDecoration` is available in the current lipgloss version. If so, use native support.\n\n### 2. If Not Available - Manual Construction\nCreate a helper function in `internal/ui/styles.go`:\n```go\n// RenderPanelWithTitle renders content with a titled border\nfunc RenderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width, height int, focused bool) string {\n    // Select border color based on focus\n    borderColor := ColorBorder\n    if focused {\n        borderColor = ColorPrimary\n    }\n    \n    // Build top border with embedded title\n    // Build side borders around content\n    // Build bottom border\n    // Return composed string\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update Panel Rendering\nIn `internal/app/app.go`, update panel View() methods to use the new helper:\n```go\nfunc (p PanelModel) View() string {\n    content := p.renderTasks()\n    return ui.RenderPanelWithTitle(p.title, content, p.width, p.height, p.focused)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Handle Dynamic Width\nThe title should truncate gracefully if the panel is too narrow:\n- Full title if it fits\n- Truncated with \"...\" if too long\n- No title if extremely narrow\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be implemented after BEADS-XXX (3-panel refactor) since that establishes the panel structure\n\n## Reference\n- [Lipgloss PR #384 - BorderDecoration](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/384)\n- [Lipgloss PR #463 - BorderTitle](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/463)\n- lazygit uses configurable border styles following neovim's convention\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Each panel displays its title embedded in the top border\n- [ ] Title styling matches lazygit aesthetic\n- [ ] Focused panel title is highlighted (different color)\n- [ ] Titles truncate gracefully on narrow terminals\n- [ ] Works with rounded border style","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:47.021335-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented embedded panel titles in borders (lazygit style)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lazybeads-4tz","depends_on_id":"lazybeads-9as","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:53.868657-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz"}]}

After the persistent status bar feature (4f0417e), the panel rendering appears to have a height calculation issue that causes content at the top of panels to be clipped.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely in the height calculation in `internal/app/app.go` in the `updateSizes()` function:\n\n```go\ncontentHeight := m.height - 2\n```\n\nThis calculation reserves 2 lines for the help bar and margins, but may not be correctly accounting for all UI elements, leading to the top of panels being cut off.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All three panels (In Progress, Open, Closed) display their full content including the top border with title\n- [ ] The panel title bar (e.g., \"╭─ Open (5) ────────╮\") is fully visible\n- [ ] Content is not clipped at the top or bottom of any panel\n- [ ] The status bar at the bottom remains visible and functional\n- [ ] The fix works correctly in both wide mode (≥80 cols) and narrow mode (\u003c80 cols)\n- [ ] Panel height distribution works correctly when:\n  - All 3 panels are visible (In Progress has items)\n  - Only 2 panels are visible (In Progress is empty)\n- [ ] No regressions in:\n  - Panel scrolling behavior\n  - Task selection/highlighting\n  - Modal overlays\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Investigate `updateSizes()` in `internal/app/app.go:343-406`**\n   - Check the `contentHeight = m.height - 2` calculation\n   - Verify this accounts for all rendered UI elements (error line, status bar, margins)\n\n2. **Check `viewMain()` in `internal/app/views.go:38-93`**\n   - The status bar is rendered on line 90 with `ui.HelpBarStyle.Render(statusText)`\n   - An error message may also be rendered (lines 82-87) which adds height\n\n3. **Verify panel View() in `internal/app/panel.go:227-333`**\n   - The panel border uses \"╭─\" for top border (line 271) \n   - Confirm the panel's allocated height matches what's rendered\n\n4. **Testing approach**\n   - Run `lazybeads` and resize terminal to various sizes\n   - Check with different numbers of tasks in each panel\n   - Test when In Progress panel is visible vs hidden\n   - Use `lazybeads --check` for headless validation","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"jeremy.saenz","created_at":"2026-01-07T17:17:38.979511-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T17:34:34.142276-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T17:34:34.14228-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed panel top borders being cut off.

{"id":"lazybeads-9as","title":"Refactor to 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed)","description":"## Overview\nRework the lazybeads TUI to display 3 vertically stacked panels on the left side (similar to lazygit's layout):\n1. **In Progress** panel (top) - Tasks with status `in_progress`\n2. **Open** panel (middle) - Tasks with status `open` \n3. **Closed** panel (bottom) - Tasks with status `closed`\n\n## Current Architecture\n- **Main file**: `internal/app/app.go` (~989 lines)\n- **Styles**: `internal/ui/styles.go`\n- **Keys**: `internal/ui/keys.go`\n- Uses modal-based navigation with `ViewMode` states (ViewList, ViewDetail, ViewForm, etc.)\n- Current h/l keys cycle through filter modes: `FilterOpen → FilterReady → FilterClosed → FilterAll`\n- Width-dependent layout: side-by-side panels on wide screens (≥80 chars)\n\n## Required Changes\n\n### 1. Create Panel Component Model\nExtract a reusable panel component that can:\n- Display a filtered list of tasks\n- Track its own selection state\n- Handle focus state (focused vs unfocused styling)\n- Render with appropriate height allocation\n\n### 2. Update Main Model Structure\n```go\ntype Model struct {\n    // Replace single list with 3 panels\n    inProgressPanel  PanelModel\n    openPanel        PanelModel  \n    closedPanel      PanelModel\n    focusedPanel     int // 0=inProgress, 1=open, 2=closed\n    \n    // Keep existing\n    detail           viewport.Model\n    tasks            []models.Task\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Implement Focus Cycling\n- h/l (or ←/→) should cycle focus between the 3 panels\n- j/k should navigate within the focused panel\n- Enter should show details for selected task in focused panel\n- Visual indication of which panel has focus (use `FocusedPanelStyle` vs `PanelStyle`)\n\n### 4. Update Layout Logic\n- Divide available height into 3 sections (can be equal thirds or proportional)\n- Stack panels vertically using `lipgloss.JoinVertical`\n- Detail panel remains on the right side (when in wide mode)\n\n### 5. Update View Rendering\n```go\nfunc (m Model) viewMain() string {\n    // Stack 3 panels vertically\n    leftColumn := lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Left,\n        m.inProgressPanel.View(),\n        m.openPanel.View(),\n        m.closedPanel.View(),\n    )\n    \n    // Join with detail panel if in wide mode\n    if m.width \u003e= 80 {\n        return lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(lipgloss.Top,\n            leftColumn,\n            m.viewDetail(),\n        )\n    }\n    return leftColumn\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Task Distribution\nWhen tasks load or refresh, distribute them to the appropriate panels:\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) distributeTasks() {\n    var inProgress, open, closed []models.Task\n    for _, t := range m.tasks {\n        switch t.Status {\n        case \"in_progress\":\n            inProgress = append(inProgress, t)\n        case \"open\":\n            open = append(open, t)\n        case \"closed\":\n            closed = append(closed, t)\n        }\n    }\n    m.inProgressPanel.SetTasks(inProgress)\n    m.openPanel.SetTasks(open)\n    m.closedPanel.SetTasks(closed)\n}\n```\n\n## Key Files to Modify\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Main refactor target\n- `internal/ui/styles.go` - Add multi-panel layout styles\n- `internal/ui/keys.go` - Update keybindings for panel focus\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 3 panels stack vertically on the left\n- [ ] Each panel shows tasks filtered by status\n- [ ] h/l cycles focus between panels (visual feedback)\n- [ ] j/k navigates within focused panel\n- [ ] Enter shows details for selected task\n- [ ] Detail panel shows on right side in wide mode\n- [ ] All existing actions (add, edit, close, delete) work on focused panel's selection","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:46.773248-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed) with h/l to cycle focus between panels"}

Dynamic keybinding registration\n\nIn `internal/ui/keys.go`:\n- Add `CustomCommands []key.Binding` slice to KeyMap\n- Populate from config at startup\n- Include in help display\n\n### 3. Command execution\n\nIn `internal/app/handlers.go`:\n- Add handler for custom command keys in `handleListKeys()` and `handleDetailKeys()`\n- Use Go `text/template` to render command with Task data\n- Execute via `exec.Command(\"sh\", \"-c\", renderedCommand).Start()` (non-blocking for tmux)\n- No need for `tea.ExecProcess` since tmux commands return immediately\n\n### 4. Help integration\n\n- Show custom commands in help view with their descriptions\n- Group separately from built-in commands\n\n## Key Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/config/config.go` (new)\n- `internal/ui/keys.go` - add CustomCommands slice\n- `internal/app/app.go` - load config, pass to Model\n- `internal/app/handlers.go` - handle custom command execution\n- `internal/app/views.go` - show custom commands in help\n- `go.mod` - add yaml dependency\n\n## Testing\n\n- Config parsing with various YAML formats\n- Template rendering with special characters\n- Command execution (mock exec)\n- Help display with custom commands\n\n## Reference\n\nLazyGit custom commands: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md\n\nUser's lazygit config pattern (for tmux/nvim integration):\n```yaml\nos:\n  edit: \u003e-\n    nvim_pane=$(tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_id}:#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iE ':n?vim' | head -1 | cut -d: -f1);\n    if [ -n \"$nvim_pane\" ]; then\n      tmux send-keys -t \"$nvim_pane\" Escape \":e {{filename}}\" Enter;\n      tmux select-pane -t \"$nvim_pane\";\n    else\n      tmux split-window -v \"nvim '{{filename}}'\";\n    fi\n```","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"jeremy.saenz","created_at":"2026-01-07T16:19:58.919705-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T16:29:22.929804-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T16:29:22.929804-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented LazyGit-style custom commands: config package for ~/.config/lazybeads/config.yml, template-based command rendering with task data, non-blocking execution for tmux integration, help view integration"}

{"id":"lazybeads-d3c","title":"Make the keyboard shortcuts pane scrollable","description":"## Problem\nThe keyboard shortcuts help pane (`?` view) displays static content that may overflow the terminal height, especially when custom commands are configured. Currently, users cannot scroll to see all shortcuts if they exceed the visible area.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] The help view supports vertical scrolling with j/k (or up/down arrow keys)\n- [ ] The help view supports page up/down (Ctrl+U/Ctrl+D)\n- [ ] The scroll position is visually indicated (e.g., percentage, scroll bar, or \"more below\" indicator)\n- [ ] The help bar at the bottom shows available scroll keys (j/k or arrows)\n- [ ] Pressing `?` or `esc` closes the help view and returns to list view\n- [ ] Scroll state resets when reopening the help view\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Current State\n- Help view is rendered in `viewHelp()` in `internal/app/views.go:113-168`\n- Content is static text built in a string, rendered with `ui.OverlayStyle`\n- No scrolling mechanism exists - content is rendered directly\n\n### Recommended Approach\n1. Add a `viewport.Model` for the help pane (similar to the detail panel)\n2. Initialize it in `New()` in `internal/app/app.go`\n3. Set content in `viewHelp()` instead of rendering directly\n4. Handle j/k/Ctrl+U/Ctrl+D keys in `handleKeyPress()` when `m.mode == ViewHelp`\n5. Update sizes in `updateSizes()` to set help viewport dimensions\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Add `helpViewport viewport.Model` to Model struct\n- `internal/app/views.go` - Update `viewHelp()` to use viewport\n- `internal/app/handlers.go` - Add scroll key handling for ViewHelp mode\n\n### Testing\n- Run `lazybeads` and press `?` to open help\n- Resize terminal to be smaller than help content height\n- Verify j/k scrolls up/down\n- Verify Ctrl+U/Ctrl+D pages up/down\n- Verify escape/? closes help view","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T17:10:36.715801-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T18:05:43.000882-08:00"}

In Progress - Active work\n2. Open/Ready - Available work  \n3. Blocked (conditional) - Work waiting on dependencies\n4. Closed (compact) - Completed work summary\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on lazybeads-9as (3-panel refactor) - need basic panel structure first\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Blocked panel only appears when blocked issues exist\n- [ ] Blocked panel positioned between Open and Closed\n- [ ] Focus cycling skips Blocked panel when not visible\n- [ ] Focus moves gracefully when Blocked panel appears/disappears\n- [ ] Closed panel shows compact summary (count only)\n- [ ] Closed panel takes minimal height (3 lines)\n- [ ] Active panels get more vertical space\n- [ ] (Optional) Closed panel can expand to show full list","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:33:53.571304-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:46:55.228746-08:00","deleted_at":"2026-01-07T13:46:55.228746-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

{"id":"lazybeads-kwgm","title":"Add configurable color theming via config.yml","description":"## Summary\n\nAllow users to customize the color theme of LazyBeads through the config file (`~/.config/lazybeads/config.yml`). Currently all colors are hardcoded in `internal/ui/styles.go`. This feature will enable personalization and better accessibility for users with different color preferences or vision needs.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Users can define a `theme` section in `config.yml` to override default colors\n- [ ] All base colors (primary, secondary, accent, warning, danger, muted, white, magenta, border) are configurable\n- [ ] Priority colors (P0-P4) can be customized\n- [ ] Status colors (open, in_progress, closed) can be customized\n- [ ] Invalid color values are handled gracefully with fallback to defaults\n- [ ] Missing theme config uses existing defaults (backward compatible)\n- [ ] Color values support both ANSI color numbers (0-255) and hex codes (#RRGGBB)\n\n## Example Config\n\n```yaml\ntheme:\n  colors:\n    primary: \"#00ff00\"     # or \"2\" for ANSI green\n    secondary: \"#0000ff\"\n    accent: \"#00ffff\"\n    warning: \"#ffff00\"\n    danger: \"#ff0000\"\n    muted: \"8\"\n    border: \"8\"\n  \n  priority:\n    p0: \"#ff0000\"          # Critical\n    p1: \"#ffaa00\"          # High\n    p2: \"#0066ff\"          # Medium\n    p3: \"8\"                # Low\n    p4: \"8\"                # Backlog\n  \n  status:\n    open: \"#00ff00\"\n    in_progress: \"#ffff00\"\n    closed: \"8\"\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n1. **`internal/config/config.go`**\n   - Add `Theme` struct to `Config`\n   - Add `ThemeColors`, `PriorityColors`, `StatusColors` sub-structs\n   - Colors should be `*string` (pointers) to distinguish unset from empty\n\n2. **`internal/ui/styles.go`**\n   - Add `InitTheme(cfg *config.Config)` function\n   - Replace hardcoded color vars with theme-aware initialization\n   - Keep existing defaults as fallbacks\n   - Add helper to parse color string (ANSI number or hex) into `lipgloss.Color`\n\n3. **`main.go`**\n   - Call `ui.InitTheme(cfg)` after loading config\n\n### Color Parsing\n\n```go\nfunc parseColor(s string, fallback lipgloss.Color) lipgloss.Color {\n    if s == \"\" {\n        return fallback\n    }\n    // lipgloss.Color accepts both ANSI numbers and hex codes\n    return lipgloss.Color(s)\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- Keep the current lazygit-inspired theme as the default\n- Validate that styles using colors are re-initialized after theme load\n- Consider adding `--config` flag diagnostic output for theme loading\n- Future: Could support named themes (e.g., `theme: catppuccin`)\n","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T17:40:44.71314-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T18:02:35.974174-08:00"}

{"id":"lazybeads-zjy","title":"Fix panel borders and equal height distribution","description":"## Problem\nThree visual issues with the current panel layout:\n\n### 1. Border Characters Are Inconsistent\nThe panel title borders appear broken/mixed. From the screenshot:\n```\n─ In Progress (0) ─══════\n```\nShould be consistent rounded borders like:\n```\n╭─ In Progress (0) ────────╮\n```\n\nLikely causes:\n- Mixing different border character sets (single `─` vs double `═`)\n- Title insertion not properly using the same border character\n- Possible encoding/rendering issue with border construction\n\n### 2. Panels Don't Fill Available Height\n- Large empty space below the Closed panel\n- All 3 panels should stretch to fill the full available height equally\n- Current behavior: panels only take the height of their content + minimal padding\n\n### 3. Long Titles Stretch Panels Instead of Truncating\n- Long issue titles cause the panel width to expand beyond the expected fixed width\n- Titles should truncate with \"...\" when they exceed the available width\n- Panel width should remain fixed regardless of content length\n\nExample from screenshot:\n```\n○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel and compact Closed panel (stash-style)\n```\nThis pushes the panel wider. Should truncate like:\n```\n○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel and com...\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Panels should divide available vertical space equally (height / 3 for each)\n- Border characters should be consistent (all rounded: `╭`, `─`, `╮`, `│`, `╰`, `╯`)\n- Title should be embedded cleanly in the top border\n- Panel width should be fixed (e.g., 50% of terminal width in wide mode)\n- Long issue titles should truncate with \"...\"\n\n## Visual Goal\n```\n╭─ In Progress (0) ─────────────────────╮\n│ (no tasks)                            │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Open (2) ────────────────────────────╮\n│ ○ P1 Fix panel borders and equal h... │\n│ ○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel... │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Closed (13) ─────────────────────────╮\n│ ● P2 Filter bar: fuzzy search...      │\n│ ● P2 Task form: create and edit...    │\n│ ...                                   │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Files to Check\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Panel height/width calculation and layout\n- `internal/ui/styles.go` - Border styling, title rendering, text truncation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All border characters are consistent (rounded style)\n- [ ] Title embedded cleanly in top border with `─` characters\n- [ ] Panels divide available height equally\n- [ ] No empty space below the bottom panel\n- [ ] Panel width is fixed, not content-dependent\n- [ ] Long issue titles truncate with \"...\"\n- [ ] Works at various terminal sizes","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:37:52.19606-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:45:21.552296-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:45:21.552296-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed panel borders, height distribution, and title truncation"}
