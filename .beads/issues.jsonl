{"id":"lazybeads-4tz","title":"Add panel titles embedded in borders (lazygit style)","description":"## Overview\nImplement panel titles that are embedded/nested within the top border of each panel, similar to how lazygit displays panel titles. The title should appear as part of the border line itself, not inside the panel content.\n\n## Visual Goal\n```\n╭─ In Progress ─────────────────╮\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nInstead of:\n```\n╭───────────────────────────────╮\n│ In Progress                   │\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Research Findings\n\n### Lipgloss Native Support (Coming Soon)\nThere are two open PRs in the lipgloss repository to add this:\n\n1. **PR #384** - `BorderDecoration` API with positioning:\n   ```go\n   style.BorderDecoration(lipgloss.NewBorderDecoration(\n       lipgloss.Top, lipgloss.Center,\n       titleStyle.Render(\"TITLE\"),\n   ))\n   ```\n\n2. **PR #463** - Simpler `BorderTitle(title string)` API\n\n### Current Workaround Options\n\n#### Option A: Manual Border Construction\nBuild the top border manually by combining border characters with the title:\n```go\nfunc renderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width int, focused bool) string {\n    borderStyle := \"─\"\n    corner := \"╭\"\n    rightCorner := \"╮\"\n    \n    // Build: ╭─ Title ─────────╮\n    titlePart := fmt.Sprintf(\" %s \", title)\n    remainingWidth := width - len(titlePart) - 2 // -2 for corners\n    topBorder := corner + borderStyle + titlePart + strings.Repeat(borderStyle, remainingWidth) + rightCorner\n    \n    // Render content with side borders only\n    // Add bottom border\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Option B: Custom Border Definition\nCreate a custom border where the top row includes the title:\n```go\nfunc titleBorder(title string, width int) lipgloss.Border {\n    topLine := \"─ \" + title + \" \" + strings.Repeat(\"─\", width-len(title)-4)\n    return lipgloss.Border{\n        Top: topLine,\n        Bottom: \"─\",\n        Left: \"│\",\n        Right: \"│\",\n        TopLeft: \"╭\",\n        TopRight: \"╮\",\n        BottomLeft: \"╰\",\n        BottomRight: \"╯\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option C: Overlay Approach\nRender the panel with border, then overlay the title on the top border using ANSI positioning (more complex, not recommended).\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Check Lipgloss Version\nFirst check if `BorderTitle` or `BorderDecoration` is available in the current lipgloss version. If so, use native support.\n\n### 2. If Not Available - Manual Construction\nCreate a helper function in `internal/ui/styles.go`:\n```go\n// RenderPanelWithTitle renders content with a titled border\nfunc RenderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width, height int, focused bool) string {\n    // Select border color based on focus\n    borderColor := ColorBorder\n    if focused {\n        borderColor = ColorPrimary\n    }\n    \n    // Build top border with embedded title\n    // Build side borders around content\n    // Build bottom border\n    // Return composed string\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update Panel Rendering\nIn `internal/app/app.go`, update panel View() methods to use the new helper:\n```go\nfunc (p PanelModel) View() string {\n    content := p.renderTasks()\n    return ui.RenderPanelWithTitle(p.title, content, p.width, p.height, p.focused)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Handle Dynamic Width\nThe title should truncate gracefully if the panel is too narrow:\n- Full title if it fits\n- Truncated with \"...\" if too long\n- No title if extremely narrow\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be implemented after BEADS-XXX (3-panel refactor) since that establishes the panel structure\n\n## Reference\n- [Lipgloss PR #384 - BorderDecoration](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/384)\n- [Lipgloss PR #463 - BorderTitle](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/463)\n- lazygit uses configurable border styles following neovim's convention\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Each panel displays its title embedded in the top border\n- [ ] Title styling matches lazygit aesthetic\n- [ ] Focused panel title is highlighted (different color)\n- [ ] Titles truncate gracefully on narrow terminals\n- [ ] Works with rounded border style","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:47.021335-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented embedded panel titles in borders (lazygit style)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lazybeads-4tz","depends_on_id":"lazybeads-9as","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:53.868657-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz"}]}

Navigation is inconsistent and unpredictable.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- j moves down exactly one item\n- k moves up exactly one item\n- Navigation should be smooth and predictable like in other panels\n\n## Observed Behavior\n- Cursor jumps multiple items at once\n- Some items are skipped entirely\n- Navigation feels \"sticky\" or erratic\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n### 1. List pagination issue\nThe closed panel may have many items (13+ in current state). The bubbles/list component might be handling pagination differently when there are more items than visible height.\n\n### 2. Height calculation mismatch\nThe list's internal height might not match the panel's content height, causing scroll/selection sync issues.\n\n### 3.

{"id":"lazybeads-9as","title":"Refactor to 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed)","description":"## Overview\nRework the lazybeads TUI to display 3 vertically stacked panels on the left side (similar to lazygit's layout):\n1. **In Progress** panel (top) - Tasks with status `in_progress`\n2. **Open** panel (middle) - Tasks with status `open` \n3. **Closed** panel (bottom) - Tasks with status `closed`\n\n## Current Architecture\n- **Main file**: `internal/app/app.go` (~989 lines)\n- **Styles**: `internal/ui/styles.go`\n- **Keys**: `internal/ui/keys.go`\n- Uses modal-based navigation with `ViewMode` states (ViewList, ViewDetail, ViewForm, etc.)\n- Current h/l keys cycle through filter modes: `FilterOpen → FilterReady → FilterClosed → FilterAll`\n- Width-dependent layout: side-by-side panels on wide screens (≥80 chars)\n\n## Required Changes\n\n### 1. Create Panel Component Model\nExtract a reusable panel component that can:\n- Display a filtered list of tasks\n- Track its own selection state\n- Handle focus state (focused vs unfocused styling)\n- Render with appropriate height allocation\n\n### 2. Update Main Model Structure\n```go\ntype Model struct {\n    // Replace single list with 3 panels\n    inProgressPanel  PanelModel\n    openPanel        PanelModel  \n    closedPanel      PanelModel\n    focusedPanel     int // 0=inProgress, 1=open, 2=closed\n    \n    // Keep existing\n    detail           viewport.Model\n    tasks            []models.Task\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Implement Focus Cycling\n- h/l (or ←/→) should cycle focus between the 3 panels\n- j/k should navigate within the focused panel\n- Enter should show details for selected task in focused panel\n- Visual indication of which panel has focus (use `FocusedPanelStyle` vs `PanelStyle`)\n\n### 4. Update Layout Logic\n- Divide available height into 3 sections (can be equal thirds or proportional)\n- Stack panels vertically using `lipgloss.JoinVertical`\n- Detail panel remains on the right side (when in wide mode)\n\n### 5. Update View Rendering\n```go\nfunc (m Model) viewMain() string {\n    // Stack 3 panels vertically\n    leftColumn := lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Left,\n        m.inProgressPanel.View(),\n        m.openPanel.View(),\n        m.closedPanel.View(),\n    )\n    \n    // Join with detail panel if in wide mode\n    if m.width \u003e= 80 {\n        return lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(lipgloss.Top,\n            leftColumn,\n            m.viewDetail(),\n        )\n    }\n    return leftColumn\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Task Distribution\nWhen tasks load or refresh, distribute them to the appropriate panels:\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) distributeTasks() {\n    var inProgress, open, closed []models.Task\n    for _, t := range m.tasks {\n        switch t.Status {\n        case \"in_progress\":\n            inProgress = append(inProgress, t)\n        case \"open\":\n            open = append(open, t)\n        case \"closed\":\n            closed = append(closed, t)\n        }\n    }\n    m.inProgressPanel.SetTasks(inProgress)\n    m.openPanel.SetTasks(open)\n    m.closedPanel.SetTasks(closed)\n}\n```\n\n## Key Files to Modify\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Main refactor target\n- `internal/ui/styles.go` - Add multi-panel layout styles\n- `internal/ui/keys.go` - Update keybindings for panel focus\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 3 panels stack vertically on the left\n- [ ] Each panel shows tasks filtered by status\n- [ ] h/l cycles focus between panels (visual feedback)\n- [ ] j/k navigates within focused panel\n- [ ] Enter shows details for selected task\n- [ ] Detail panel shows on right side in wide mode\n- [ ] All existing actions (add, edit, close, delete) work on focused panel's selection","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:46.773248-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed) with h/l to cycle focus between panels"}

{"id":"lazybeads-ej4","title":"Add conditional Blocked panel and compact Closed panel (stash-style)","description":"## Overview\nTwo enhancements to the panel layout:\n\n1. **Blocked Panel** - A conditional panel that only appears when there are blocked issues, positioned below Open/Ready tasks\n2. **Compact Closed Panel** - Instead of listing all closed issues, show a compacted single-line summary (like lazygit's stash panel)\n\n## Visual Goal\n\n### When blocked issues exist:\n```\n╭─ In Progress (2) ─────────────╮\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Open (5) ────────────────────╮\n│ BEADS-004 Add user settings   │\n│ BEADS-007 Update docs         │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Blocked (1) ─────────────────╮\n│ BEADS-002 Deploy to prod      │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Closed ──────────────────────╮\n│   12 closed issues            │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n### When no blocked issues:\n```\n╭─ In Progress (2) ─────────────╮\n│ ...                           │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Open (5) ────────────────────╮\n│ ...                           │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Closed ──────────────────────╮\n│   12 closed issues            │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Blocked Panel Details\n\n### Conditional Rendering\n- Only render the Blocked panel if `len(blockedTasks) \u003e 0`\n- When it appears, it should be focusable like other panels\n- When it disappears (last blocked issue resolved), focus should move to adjacent panel\n\n### Data Source\nUse `bd blocked` or filter tasks where `blocked_by` is not empty:\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) getBlockedTasks() []models.Task {\n    var blocked []models.Task\n    for _, t := range m.tasks {\n        if len(t.BlockedBy) \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 t.Status != \"closed\" {\n            blocked = append(blocked, t)\n        }\n    }\n    return blocked\n}\n```\n\n### Focus Management\n```go\ntype PanelType int\nconst (\n    PanelInProgress PanelType = iota\n    PanelOpen\n    PanelBlocked  // Only in focus rotation when visible\n    PanelClosed\n)\n\nfunc (m *Model) getVisiblePanels() []PanelType {\n    panels := []PanelType{PanelInProgress, PanelOpen}\n    if len(m.blockedTasks) \u003e 0 {\n        panels = append(panels, PanelBlocked)\n    }\n    panels = append(panels, PanelClosed)\n    return panels\n}\n```\n\n## Compact Closed Panel Details\n\n### Stash-Style Display\nLike lazygit's stash panel, show a minimal summary instead of listing items:\n- Single line showing count: `12 closed issues`\n- Or if empty: `No closed issues`\n- Optionally show recent closure: `12 closed (latest: 2h ago)`\n\n### Expandable Behavior (Optional Enhancement)\nCould support Enter to expand into full list view:\n- Default: Compact single-line summary\n- Press Enter on Closed panel: Expand to show list of closed issues\n- Press Esc or Enter again: Collapse back to summary\n\n### Implementation\n```go\ntype ClosedPanelModel struct {\n    count    int\n    expanded bool\n    tasks    []models.Task\n    // ...\n}\n\nfunc (p ClosedPanelModel) View() string {\n    if p.expanded {\n        // Render full list like other panels\n        return p.renderTaskList()\n    }\n    // Render compact summary\n    summary := fmt.Sprintf(\"  %d closed issues\", p.count)\n    return ui.RenderPanelWithTitle(\"Closed\", summary, p.width, 3, p.focused)\n}\n```\n\n### Height Allocation\n- Compact closed panel should take minimal height (3 lines: top border, content, bottom border)\n- More vertical space available for active panels (In Progress, Open, Blocked)\n\n## Dynamic Height Distribution\nWith conditional panels and compact closed, height allocation becomes dynamic:\n\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) calculatePanelHeights() {\n    available := m.height - 4 // margins\n    closedHeight := 3         // Fixed minimal height for compact\n    \n    visibleActivePanels := 2  // In Progress + Open\n    if len(m.blockedTasks) \u003e 0 {\n        visibleActivePanels++\n    }\n    \n    activeHeight := (available - closedHeight) / visibleActivePanels\n    \n    m.inProgressPanel.SetHeight(activeHeight)\n    m.openPanel.SetHeight(activeHeight)\n    if len(m.blockedTasks) \u003e 0 {\n        m.blockedPanel.SetHeight(activeHeight)\n    }\n    m.closedPanel.SetHeight(closedHeight)\n}\n```\n\n## Panel Order (Top to Bottom)\n1. In Progress - Active work\n2. Open/Ready - Available work  \n3. Blocked (conditional) - Work waiting on dependencies\n4. Closed (compact) - Completed work summary\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on lazybeads-9as (3-panel refactor) - need basic panel structure first\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Blocked panel only appears when blocked issues exist\n- [ ] Blocked panel positioned between Open and Closed\n- [ ] Focus cycling skips Blocked panel when not visible\n- [ ] Focus moves gracefully when Blocked panel appears/disappears\n- [ ] Closed panel shows compact summary (count only)\n- [ ] Closed panel takes minimal height (3 lines)\n- [ ] Active panels get more vertical space\n- [ ] (Optional) Closed panel can expand to show full list","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:33:53.571304-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:46:55.228746-08:00","deleted_at":"2026-01-07T13:46:55.228746-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

From the screenshot:\n```\n─ In Progress (0) ─══════\n```\nShould be consistent rounded borders like:\n```\n╭─ In Progress (0) ────────╮\n```\n\nLikely causes:\n- Mixing different border character sets (single `─` vs double `═`)\n- Title insertion not properly using the same border character\n- Possible encoding/rendering issue with border construction\n\n### 2. Panels Don't Fill Available Height\n- Large empty space below the Closed panel\n- All 3 panels should stretch to fill the full available height equally\n- Current behavior: panels only take the height of their content + minimal padding\n\n### 3. Long Titles Stretch Panels Instead of Truncating\n- Long issue titles cause the panel width to expand beyond the expected fixed width\n- Titles should truncate with \"...\" when they exceed the available width\n- Panel width should remain fixed regardless of content length\n\nExample from screenshot:\n```\n○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel and compact Closed panel (stash-style)\n```\nThis pushes the panel wider. Should truncate like:\n```\n○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel and com...\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Panels should divide available vertical space equally (height / 3 for each)\n- Border characters should be consistent (all rounded: `╭`, `─`, `╮`, `│`, `╰`, `╯`)\n- Title should be embedded cleanly in the top border\n- Panel width should be fixed (e.g., 50% of terminal width in wide mode)\n- Long issue titles should truncate with \"...\"\n\n## Visual Goal\n```\n╭─ In Progress (0) ─────────────────────╮\n│ (no tasks)                            │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Open (2) ────────────────────────────╮\n│ ○ P1 Fix panel borders and equal h... │\n│ ○ P1 Add conditional Blocked panel... │\n│                                       │\n│                                       │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n╭─ Closed (13) ─────────────────────────╮\n│ ● P2 Filter bar: fuzzy search...      │\n│ ● P2 Task form: create and edit...    │\n│ ...                                   │\n╰───────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Files to Check\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Panel height/width calculation and layout\n- `internal/ui/styles.go` - Border styling, title rendering, text truncation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All border characters are consistent (rounded style)\n- [ ] Title embedded cleanly in top border with `─` characters\n- [ ] Panels divide available height equally\n- [ ] No empty space below the bottom panel\n- [ ] Panel width is fixed, not content-dependent\n- [ ] Long issue titles truncate with \"...\"\n- [ ] Works at various terminal sizes","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:37:52.19606-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:45:21.552296-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:45:21.552296-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed panel borders, height distribution, and title truncation"}
